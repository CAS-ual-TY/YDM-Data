When this card is activated you can add 1 \"Elemental HERO Neos\" or \"Neo Spacian\" monster or 1 card that specifically lists \"Neo-Spacian\" in it’s card text. If you Special Summon a Fusion Monster that lists \"Elemental HERO Neos\" as a Fusion Material Monster; you can Special Summon \"Elemental HERO Neos\" from your hand, Deck, or GY. Fusion Monsters that list \"Elemental HERO Neos\" as a Fusion Material Monster do not have to activate their effects during the End Phase that shuffle them into the Extra Deck. You can only use each effect of \"Neo Space NEXT\" once per turn.",
